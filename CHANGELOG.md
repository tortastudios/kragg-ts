# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Because kragg's output is consumed by CI jobs and coding agents, two things
count as **breaking** here even though they are not API changes in the usual
sense:

- a change to the report JSON (`schema_version`, key names, value shapes), and
- a change to what an exit code means.

Both are a contract shared with the Python implementation. New *gates* and new
*violation codes* are additive and are not breaking, even though they can turn
a previously green run red — see [Gate additions](#gate-additions) below.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **TOR-1376** — metric-gate calibration on representative TypeScript
  projects, and a regression net so the result cannot be undone quietly.
  `scripts/calibrate.ts` measures `complexity`, `maintainability`, `halstead`,
  `type-complexity` and `nullable-default` against a list of sample roots by
  calling the same gate entry points `check` calls, and reports the population
  each violation count came out of — violation rates, order statistics,
  distribution buckets and per-finding distance from the budget — as JSON or a
  markdown table. It adds no dependency and spawns nothing except `git
  rev-parse` through the approved runner.
  [`docs/calibration.md`](docs/calibration.md) records a dated run over a CLI,
  a Next.js application, a pnpm workspace and the three scaffolds (472
  application files, 3,025 blocks, 3,099 annotation sites), with a per-finding
  precision assessment, suppression frequency and remediation cost.
  `test/fixtures/knownDefects.ts` and `test/knownDefects.test.ts` hold one
  measured defect per metric gate plus a clean control, so a future threshold
  change that stops detecting any of them fails the suite instead of passing
  quietly. `KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` now states the measured precision limits —
  chiefly that `??`/`?.` supply 12–19% of a TypeScript cyclomatic score, that
  roughly a third of a React score is JSX rendering, that Halstead counts
  static markup and a block's nested closures, and that the type-aware tier
  sees one tsconfig and so covers a workspace only in part.
  **No threshold, grade band, profile or default was changed**: the proposals
  the measurements support are written up in `docs/calibration.md` and marked
  as not applied, because each one is a number Python kragg also ships.

### Fixed

- **TOR-1359** — `tsc` in incremental mode (`--changed`, `--file`, and
  therefore the Claude PostToolUse hook) no longer hides type errors outside
  the selected files. The whole project was already compiled through its own
  `tsconfig.json`, but every diagnostic whose file was not in the selection was
  dropped — including the error in `b.ts` that an edit to `a.ts` introduced, so
  the gate reported `[PASS] tsc` and exit 0 while `tsc -p tsconfig.json` was
  failing. Nothing is dropped now: the whole-project verdict is the verdict.
  Diagnostics with no file come first, then those in the selected files, then
  the rest, and the report's existing dedupe and per-gate cap handle volume.

## [0.0.0] — unreleased

Initial implementation. Not published to npm.

### Added

**The engine and its contract**

- `kragg check` / `kragg security`, running a fixed pipeline of 18 gates in two
  tiers. All fast gates run even after one fails, so a single invocation
  surfaces every failure; slow gates skip once a fast gate has failed.
- Exit codes `0` pass / `1` violations / `2` usage or config error / `3`
  environment broken. Exit 3 outranks exit 1.
- `--format json` emitting `schema_version` 1 with snake_case keys, matching
  the Python implementation byte for byte.
- `.kragg/history.jsonl` run journal, and `kragg status` to read it back.

**Native gates** (no external tool, built on the TypeScript compiler API)

- `typing-strictness` — audits that `tsconfig.json` meets the strict floor,
  carries no escape hatches (`@ts-ignore`, `as any`, double casts,
  `@ts-nocheck`), **and covers every source file**.
- `complexity`, `maintainability`, `halstead` — radon's metrics over the
  TypeScript AST.
- `type-complexity` — annotation nesting and length budgets.
- `boundaries` — the layered import contract, resolving tsconfig `paths`
  aliases and following barrel re-export chains.
- `structure` — file-length and public-symbol budgets, enumerating `export *`.
- `forbidden-calls` — project-banned APIs resolved through `ts.TypeChecker`.
- `nullable-default` — `||` mis-coalescing a legitimate `0` / `""` / `false`.
- `secret-default` — secrets given silent fallback values.
- `critical-tests`, `test-quality`, `critical-coverage` — the test-depth gates.

**External tool adapters**, each resolved from the project's own
`node_modules/.bin` and skipping visibly with an install command when absent

- `lint` — oxlint, biome or eslint, auto-detected from project config.
- `tsc` — the project's own compiler.
- `test-coverage` — vitest, `node --test` or `bun test`; istanbul JSON and lcov.
- `audit` — npm, pnpm, yarn or bun.
- `detect-secrets` — gitleaks or secretlint. **No scanner is bundled.**

**Commands**

- `map`, `spec`, `brief`, `coverage`, `criticality`, `mutation`, `flaky`,
  `audit`, `doctor`, `policy show`, `fix`.
- `new` (`cli` | `api` | `mcp`), `gen module`, `init`.
- `hook claude` — reads hook JSON on stdin; fails open by design.

### Deliberate divergences from the Python implementation

Each is documented at the site, and collected in `README.md`.

- `forbidden-calls` resolves through the type checker, so subclass overrides,
  unannotated receivers and re-export chains are caught.
- `nullable-default` is a redesign; `.get(k, default)` has no JS analogue.
- Cyclomatic complexity scores a `switch` **once**, not once per `case`, on
  measured evidence that flat dispatch tables were failing the gate without
  being complex.
- `structure` counts real `export` declarations rather than a
  leading-underscore convention.
- `secret_name_suffixes` includes `ServiceKey`.
- Criticality data carries a sidecar freshness stamp so stale call-graph data
  is re-derived rather than trusted. `criticality.json` itself stays readable
  by the Python implementation.

### Known limitations

Stated in full in [KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md). The short
version: complexity thresholds are Python's and were never recalibrated;
`nullable-default` is high-precision and low-recall by design; scaffold
templates for hono, fastmcp and `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` were never
compiled; Stryker's handshake has never been executed; Windows is untested.

### Supply chain

- One runtime dependency (`typescript`) and one dev dependency
  (`@types/node`), both pinned to exact versions. No bundler, no test
  framework.
- pnpm pinned via corepack, dependency lifecycle scripts disabled, empty build
  allowlist, and a 30-day minimum release age enforced mechanically.

## Gate additions

A new gate, or a new violation code on an existing gate, can turn a
previously green run red without anything in your code changing. That is the
tool working, not a regression — but it is disruptive, so:

- New gates and codes are listed in the release notes, always.
- A new gate that requires configuration **skips visibly** until configured,
  rather than failing a project that has not opted in.
- Existing violation codes are not repurposed. If the meaning of a check
  changes, it gets a new code.
